Design & Conduct Experiments For
Marketing Campaigns
Design and conduct experiments for marketing campaigns.
• Learn about experimental design and its application in marketing.
• Design experiments using examples from marketing scenarios.
• Implement randomization and sample splitting techniques.
• Conduct the experiments and collect relevant data for analysis.

Interpretation and Implications:
The following are the Sample Sizes:
• Control Data: 666 observations.
• Sampled Data: 568 observations.
• Selected Data: 2240 observations.
• Superstore Data: 2240 observations (initial dataset).
• Treatment Data: 1574 observations.
• Sample Size: 1568 (seems to be a specified or calculated value).
Randomization Outcome: The randomization procedure allocated 666 observations to the control group and 1574
observations to the treatment group. This random assignment helps avoid bias when analyzing the impact of different
factors on customer behavior.
Simple Random Sample: A simple random sample extracted 568 observations from the initial dataset (superstore data)
for analysis. This sample represents a subset of the entire dataset and allows for analysis while retaining the diversity 
ofobservations.
Sample Size: The specified sample size for analysis appears to be 1568, which is close to the combined size of the
control and treatment groups. It might represent the desired sample size for the experiment or analysis.
Conclusion: The randomization and sampling procedures have successfully divided the dataset into control and
treatment groups and extracted a random sample for analysi
