Hypothesis Testing In Experiment 
Outcomes
Understand the concept of hypothesis testing and its role in assessing experiment
outcomes.
• Explore the purpose of hypothesis testing in analyzing experiment results.
• Familiarize with key terminologies related to hypothesis testing.
• Learn the process of hypothesis testing and power calculation.
• Conduct hypothesis testing using R to evaluate experiment outcomes.
#Null Hypothesis (H0):
#H0: There is no significant relationship between a customer's age and the number of web purchases made.
#Alternative Hypothesis (Ha):
#Ha: There is a significant relationship between a customer's age and the number of web purchases made.

Interpretation and Implications:
T-Test Result: The extremely small p-value (< 0.0001) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting 
ahighly significant difference between the mean age and the mean number of web purchases. The confidence interval
also confirms this significant difference, indicating that the means of the two groups (age and web purchases) are not
equal.
Two Sample t-test:
• t-value: 7558.7
• Degrees of Freedom (df): 2479.1
• p-value: < 2.2e-16 (extremely small)
• Confidence Interval: 95% CI for the difference in means: (1964.211, 1965.231)
• Sample Estimates: Mean of 'Year_Birth': 1968.805804, Mean of 'NumWebPurchases': 4.084821
Power Calculation:
The calculated statistical power of 1 indicates a high probability of correctly detecting the observedeffect (difference in 
means) if it truly exists in the population. A power of 1 suggests that the study is well-powered to detect the effect,
leaving almost no chance of a Type II error (false negative).
• Sample Size (n): 100 in each group.
• Effect Size (d): 225.8605.
• Significance Level (sig.level): 0.05 Power (power): 1 (High)
