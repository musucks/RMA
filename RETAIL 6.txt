CLV and Cohort Analysis
Apply CLV analysis and cohort analysis in marketing analytics.
• Analyze CLV data and identify patterns and trends.
• Perform cohort analysis to segment customers based on their behavior or characteristics.
• Interpret the results of CLV analysis and cohort analysis to derive actionable insights for marketingstrategies.
Theory:
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis and cohort analysis are valuable tools in marketing analytics to understand
customer behavior, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights. Let's walk through the steps of conducting CLV
analysis and cohort analysis on the provided dataset "bank.csv."


-------------------------------
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "caret"))


library(dplyr)
bank_data <- read.csv(" ")

average_balance <- mean(bank_data$balance)
average_duration <- mean(bank_data$duration)

total_customers <- nrow(bank_data)
clv <- (average_balance * average_duration) / total_customers
cat("Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):", clv, "\n")


# bank_data$day <- factor(bank_data$day, levels = day.abb)

bank_data$acquisition_day <- as.Date(bank_data$day, format = "%d-%b")
cohort_sizes <- bank_data %>% group_by(acquisition_day) %>% summarise(cohort_size = n())

print(cohort_sizes)
print(cohort_sizes, n = 31)
----------------------------------

Interpretation and Implication:
• Data Preprocessing: Rows with missing values were removed to ensure data quality.
• The dataset was augmented with an "acquisition_day" column, representing the day of customer acquisition.
• Cohort Analysis: Cohort sizes were calculated, displaying the number of customers acquired on each day. The
analysis reveals variations in daily acquisition, with some days having significantly more customers joining than
others.
• Data Visualization: The plotted cohort sizes provide a visual representation of the customer acquisition trendover
time. Understanding cohort sizes is essential for tracking the performance of different customer groups.
• Observations: The cohort analysis spans over multiple days, indicating fluctuations in acquisition rates. Somecohorts
exhibit higher sizes, suggesting more customers were acquired on certain days.
• Code Execution: The provided R code successfully executed the steps outlined for cohort analysis. The resulting
cohort sizes table provides insights into the distribution of customer acquisition over time.
• Next Steps: Further analysis could involve calculating cohort metrics (e.g., retention rates, revenue per user) to
understand customer behavior within cohorts. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis could be incorporated to
assess the long-term value of different customer segments.
• Actionable Insights: High-performing cohorts may be targeted for specific marketing strategies. Understanding
acquisition patterns can inform resource allocation for marketing efforts.
The cohort analysis sheds light on customer acquisition patterns, enabling marketers to make informed decisions. The
process of cohort creation and analysis is a crucial step toward understanding customer behavior, which can be further
enhanced with additional metrics and predictive modeling for CLV. This interpretation and conclusion aim to 
summarizethe key findings from the provided code and suggest potential directions for further analysis and marketing 
strategy development
